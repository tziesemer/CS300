Projects from CS300

Q: What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
A: To design and create a program to read courses from a file, store them in an appropriate data structure, and allow users to view course list or more data on a specific course.

Q: How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
A: First I started by learning about three major data structures: vectors, hash tables, and binary search tress. Then I created psuedocode for all the needed functions for each of these data structures. After that I analyzed runtime complexity and other pros and cons for each structure. Once I made a descition based on these factors I made a program using the selected data structure.

Q: How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
A: First I had issues with visual studio. I have been working with visual code for awhile and it is just different enough that I had issues. For most of these issues I just followed basic troubleshooting with isolating the problem, checking if I knew the solution, if not then searching for the solution, implimenting solution, checking if it fixed all issues, and finally documenting and commiting the solution to memory. This served me pretty well and the other big thing was being willing to make decisions in the abscence of explicit instruction.

Q: How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
A: This project pushed me to do a lot more psuedocoding, designing, and analyisis than I have in the past. I have come to appreciate the design phase of coding more and I have learned a lot about data structures too.

Q: How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
A: As stated above I will be spending more time in the design phase of programming which includes analyising what is the best choices for each project. This includes maintainability, added proper comments for readability, and making code that can be adapted to multiple uses rather than too much unique code.
